The following question pertains to uniform and non-uniform quantizers. This is a programming exercise. 

(a) The PDF of a zero-mean Gaussian random variable has the following form Assume the variance to be one and plot the 

(b) Apply a Uniform Quantizer to the PDF in (a). Make a new figure showing the decision boundaries and reconstruction 
le\els superimposed on the PDF of (a). Vary the number of decision boundaries and plot the quantization error versus the 
number of quantization levels. 

(c) Implement the LIyod-Max Algorithm to the PDF of (a). Make a new figure showing the decision boundaries and 
reconstruction levels superimposed on the PDF of (a). Vary the number of decision boundaries and plot the quantization 
error versus the number of quantization levels. 

(d) For both (a) and (b) choose the same number of quantization levels and compare the performance between (a) and (b) 
in terms of quantization errors. 

(e) Compare your answer with the values given on pages 104 (Table 4.1) and 116 (Table 4.3) of "Fundamentals of Digital 
Image Processing" by Anil K. Jain 


Notes: 
Your code needs to be he√¶,ily commented. 

Code for the Uniform Quantizer and Llyod-Max Algorithm MUST be written as separate subroutines. 

Cannot use library functions to implement the uniform quantizer and LIyod-Max algorithm 

Use the definition of Gaussian random variable to implement it. No libraries allowed. 

Allowed programming languages = C++, Java, MATLAB, Python
